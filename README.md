# Caltech-101-CNN

Convolutional Neural Network and image processing

This is a python notebook which contains the implementation of Deep Convolution Neural Network, for classification of images. It was made for learning and understanding the practical implementation of CNN and Deep Learning.  
I have mentioned some of the important points while, creating the notebook, for future reference.
